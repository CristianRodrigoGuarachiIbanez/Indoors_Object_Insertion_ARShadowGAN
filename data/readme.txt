Shadow-AR dataset is an image dataset which contains five kinds of images.
Corresponding images in different directories have the same name.
The directories and contents are:

(1) [noshadow] AR images without virtual object shadows
(2) [mask] mask images of virtual objects
(3) [rshadow] matting of real-world shadows
(4) [robject] mask images of occluders of corresponding shadows
(5) [shadow] AR images with plausible virtual object shadows

Shadow-AR dataset is free for non-commercial research. You can merge or re-split it as desired.
